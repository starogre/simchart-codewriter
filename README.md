# simchart-codewriter
A tool that helped me grab XML data and tie it to UI elements

Takes a list of element names you specify and does a lot of string work to write code that's easily copy-pasted

1. Write the name of each piece of data on a new line in a text file as a list of strings. Name it test.txt and put it in bin/Debug

2. Run CodeWriterSimChart.exe

3. test2.txt file is created with all necessary code that defines and assigns element names and declares variables that fits into the UI

Note: This was written for a specific project, but if you're looking to do something similar, this would be a good example
